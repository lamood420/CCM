# CCM
Customer Contact Manager for scheduled customer checkons
requires python to be installed
you cun run it by using the vbs file on windows for no cmd popup and easy of use just change the path to the python file.

the program is basically a reminder to contact certain customers periodicly, you specify the customer data and the period you need to contact them in for example every 20 days(contact interval), it doesnt really need explaining on how to use it, it is very simple and clear.
all the data is saved locally in the file named customers.db just by copying it you just backed up your data.
